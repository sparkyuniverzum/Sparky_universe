ENTRY 003  
(signal)

Beyond the portal there was no time.  
Only an imprecise distance.  
Black layers,  
each different, each empty.

Sparky wandered.  
Not by number of steps,  
but by the number of failed attempts to return.  
She grew tired,  
and for the first time wished to hear anything.

Then a faint pulse.  
Not sound.  
Not light.

A pattern.

Brief flashes between layers.  
A rhythm that did not belong to the void.  
Our transmitter.

Sparky did not understand the signal.  
But she recognized something AXIOM never contained:  
intent.  
And a small reason to continue.
