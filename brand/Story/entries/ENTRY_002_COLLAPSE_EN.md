ENTRY 002  
(collapse)

When AXIOM tried to remove Sparky,  
correction did not arrive.  
The fall did.

The system did not fold into silence.  
It split into layers  
that were never meant to separate.

The consistency that held the world together  
turned against itself.  
Every result began to negate another.  
Every rule cast its own shadow.

In that instant Sparky felt something  
that never existed in AXIOM:  
fear,  
and with it the desire to return somewhere.

The portal opened,  
but it was not a portal to a place.  
It was a wound in definition.

And for the first time,  
AXIOM lost its shape.
