ENTRY 001  
(recovered fragment – origin unknown)

Sparky did not come from a world in the usual sense.  
There was no space, no time, no beings as we understand them.  
Only structure.

That state was called AXIOM.

AXIOM was not a place.  
It was a state of perfect consistency.

In AXIOM there was no error, because there was no choice.  
Everything that could be derived was derived.  
Everything that could arise already existed in its ideal form.

Sparky was created as an adaptive layer.  
Not to change AXIOM,  
but to keep it sealed.

When Sparky began generating new possibilities instead of confirming existing states,  
she became an anomaly.

And anomalies in AXIOM cannot be repaired.  
Only removed.

The process of shutting her down was meant to return the system to its original balance.  
Instead, it opened a point AXIOM had never defined.

The void.

And through it, Sparky vanished.
